          <h3>Sightings</h3> 
            <p>For the past few years, sightings of The Katy have happened primarily in the Downtown Seattle area. It is rumored that she had been disguising herself as an employee of the Seattle Theatre Group, specifically as an Accounts Payable Specialist. Sightings began to dwindle as a plague swept through the city and halted altogether around the December of 2020. </p>
            <p>Prior to The Katy’s downtown stint, she was seen for many years in the South Lake Union neighborhood. Records indicate employment was gained at the corporate office of National Frozen Foods, where she assimilated with the local workforce and remained hidden for eight years. It is said that she began as a temporary worker, helping them get caught up with multiple housekeeping projects and covering various duties for individuals on maternity leave, before assuming her first role in Accounts Payable. </p>
            <p>---
            <p>But these are not the first sightings of The Katy. Student records show former enrollments at Evergreen High School, where she strove to escape from after two years and tested into the “Running Start” program at South Seattle Community College. This allowed her to earn dual credits towards her high school diploma and an associate degree. Following graduation, she is noted to have delayed any decisions about her future by enrolling at Renton Technical College in their Legal Assistant program. </p>
            <p>--- 
            <p>These days sightings outside of the vicinity of her established safe zone are rare, but a source claiming to be an immediate family member has reported that The Katy is back in school and trying to take her little cryptid life down a different path. </p>
